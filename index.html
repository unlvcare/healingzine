        <h2>Healing is an <span class="italic">ongoing process</span> that requires moving through and beyond the impact of trauma</h2>
        <p>The Care Center is committed to serving students on campus that have been impacted by interpersonal violence through our trauma-informed and healing centered advocacy. Due to the nature of the services we offer, we witness firsthand the adverse effects trauma can have on the mind, body, and spirit. There is no one size fits all solution; however, everyone has an innate capacity to heal. </p>
        <p>The <span class="italic">Student's Guide to Radical Healing</span> zine is a resource that gives information on trauma, offers an introduction to different healing modalities and tools as well as how to access them.</p>
