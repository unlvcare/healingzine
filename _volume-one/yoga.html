  <h2>Yoga</h2>
  <p>Yoga, like meditation, can reduce stress,
    depression, and anxiety while also creating
    a connection between the mind and body.
    While yoga cannot address the root causes
    of trauma, it can alleviate traumatic stress
    symptoms.</p>
  <p>We know that trauma can live in the body and show up in
    physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual ways. Yoga can
    create reconnection and trust within your body.</p>
  <p>It’s important to note that the origin of yoga did not focus on exercise or
    weight loss, instead of movement, flow and deep connection between your
    mind and body. While yoga poses may be challenging they shouldn’t hurt,
    and you do not need to be an expert to try yoga. Trauma-informed yoga is
    a specific focus in which the guide or facilitator asks for consent before
    touching others, using scents or turning off the lights.</p>

  <h3 class="zine-subhead img-margin-reduce">Try a Healing Meditation Practice!</h3>
  <p>The following mantra meditation, as taught by master teacher Sri
    Dharma Mittra, gives the mind an anchor to return to when traumatic
    sensations or memories surface.</p>
  <ol class="subtitled-ol">
      <li>Preparation
        <p>Sit in a comfortable cross-legged position (or on a chair with your
          feet flat on the floor) and your hands resting comfortably on your
          thighs, with palms facing up.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Coordination
        <p>Synchronize the breath with the following syllables and mudras
          (hand gestures). Inhale to the count of four as you slowly and
          gently close your fingers in toward your palms, keeping thumbs
          soft, while silently saying the first syllable. Exhale to the count
          of four as you slowly and gently open your palms while silently
          intoning the second syllable, and so on.</p>
        <p class="italic">HUM (inhale)…SA (exhale)…SO (inhale)…HUM (exhale) SO
          (inhale)…HUM (exhale)…HUM (inhale)…SA (exhale) SO
          (inhale)…HUM (exhale)…HUM (inhale)…SA (exhale) HUM
          (inhale)….SA (exhale)…SO (inhale)…HUM (exhale)</p>
        <p>Repeat the pattern for several rounds.</p>
