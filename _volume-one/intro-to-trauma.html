  <h2>Introduction to Trauma</h2>
  <p>There are many different forms of trauma and many
    different ways that trauma can impact us. It can be scary
    to not know why we are feeling the way we are. So, this
    section will explain what trauma is and how it shows up and
    impacts all of our systems.</p>
    <p>Some forms of trauma may be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct or indirect harm;</li>
        <li>Being threatened with harm, especially over a period of time;</li>
        <li>Witnessing harm being done to or by others;</li>
        <li>Intentional or accidental harm by others;</li>
        <li>Learning that a traumatic event occurred to a close family member or close friend; or</li>
        <li>Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of a traumatic event.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Trauma is an experience that causes <span class="bold">physical, mental,
        emotional, spiritual, or social harm,</span> including lack of sleep,
        depression, anxiety, loss of appetite, nightmares, heightened
        sensories (always feeling like you’re on alert), a strain on
        friendships and relationships, a feeling of disconnection to
        yourself or beliefs, and more.</p>
    <p>Trauma can impact your:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Behavior</span> (feeling numb, distant, overwhelmed, anxious, etc)</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Memory</span></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Cognitive Abilities</span> (having difficulty focusing, completing tasks, etc.)</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Physical Health</span> (stomach pain, gastrointestinal issues, headaches)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Trauma also has an impact on your brain. When a traumatic experience occurs, these areas of the brain are impacted:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Prefrontal Cortex</span> – The “Director” that provides executive
            functions, i.e. focuses attention based on goals and tasks
            for a situation, engages in logical reasoning and thinking
            through how to handle things with steps, monitors our own
            behavior, inhibits impulses, and controls emotions. “Topdown” thinking.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Amygdala</span> – The “smoke detector” that is always on, and
            monitors for signs in the environment of danger. The
            amygdala controls the fear circuitry in the brain.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Hippocampus</span> – The “hard drive” where the brain
            consolidates encoded memories into long term storage.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Thalamus</span> – The “sensory area” that translates sights,
            sounds, tastes, and smells into the language of the brain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So what happens:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The fear circuitry from the amygdala takes control due
            to a flood of stress hormones meaning the “smoke
            detector” can remain on high alert even after the
            safety threat is gone.</li>
        <li>A loss of prefrontal regulation changes attention and
            focus to “bottom-up.” This can make it extremely
            difficult to focus, think logically and can impact your
            behavior.</li>
        <li class="bullet-lvl-two"><span class="italic">For example,</span> your brain may shift into survival
            reflexes and engage in self-protection habits even
            if they are potentially harmful or detrimental to
            yourself or others.</li>
        <li>Trauma can also cause altered memory encoding
            meaning your memory of a traumatic event may be
            fuzzy, not in chronological order while some memories
            may be extremely vivid - especially those connected to
            senses (for example, you may be able to remember the
            smells or sounds clearly while drawing a blank on time,
            faces, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
