  <h2>Readings on Trauma</h2>
  <p>Sometimes the hardest part of trauma is not understanding what’s happening
    or why it’s happening. We question our reaction to things, wonder if we’ll
    ever be the same, or if anyone else is feeling this way. For some, reading and
    information gathering gives them a sense of control back. While it’s important
    to have boundaries and not overwhelm yourself with research and information,
    because that can just be retraumatizing, doing some light reading here and
    there may be comforting.</p>
  <p>Here is a list of some books to start with - this is not an exhaustive list and if
    none of them speak to you that’s ok! Our office also has a healing library with
    limited books on healing and trauma that you can check-out for free.</p>
