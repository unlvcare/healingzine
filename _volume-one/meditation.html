  <h2>Meditation</h2>
  <p>Meditation is an ancient cultural spiritual practice particularly from India,
    China, and Japan, but elements of meditation can be found in many cultures
    across the world. In recent times, western science has been able to explore
    the benefits for the mind and body. Meditation is known for reducing stress,
    depression, and anxiety. Research shows that with a consistent practice
    of meditation we have the ability to change neural networks in our brain
    particularly the area that regulates executive functions like the fear circuitry,
    this is called neuroplasticity. We all have an innate ability to heal ourselves and
    our ancestors have known this.</p>
  <p>Meditation can offer new insights and can open opportunities for new
    perspectives however it is not something that happens right away. In fact,
    starting a meditation practice can be a challenging experience for a number of
    reasons. Meditation asks you to pay attention to your breath and body but for
    people that have experienced trauma in their bodies, this can activate a stress
    response and flashbacks can arise. If this happens to you, you’re not alone and
    it doesn’t mean you can’t meditate, it just means that you have to approach
    meditation to a trauma-informed lens.</p>
