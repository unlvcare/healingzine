  <h2>Self Care Assessment</h2>
  <p>No clue where to start? Feeling like you just need to sit down and address what
    you’ve been doing and what you want to be doing? This self-care assessment
    may help you identify areas that you want to pour more energy into. Remember
    it’s not about grading yourself, but instead being aware of your needs, which
    only you know.</p>
  <p>Adapted from Saakvitne, Pearlman, & Staff of TSI/CAAP (1996). <span class="italic">Transforming
    the pain: A workbook on vicarious traumatization.</span> Norton.</p>
  <p>The following worksheet for assessing self-care is not exhaustive, merely
    suggestive. Feel free to add areas of self-care that are relevant for you and rate
    yourself on how often and how well you are taking care of yourself these days.</p>
  <p>When you are finished, look for patterns in your responses.
    Are you more active in some areas of self-care but ignore
    others? Are there items on the list that make you think, “I
    would never do that”? Listen to your inner responses, your
    internal dialogue about self-care and making yourself a
    priority. Take particular note of anything you would like to
    include more in your life.</p>
