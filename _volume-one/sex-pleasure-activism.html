  <h2>Sex & Pleasure Activism</h2>
  <p>In this section, we encourage you to explore inviting pleasure into your
    healing journey. Adrienne Maree Brown’s book, Pleasure Activism, inspires us
    and helps us understand that pleasure is key to understanding the trauma
    we’ve experienced, and to sustain our healing journey, we have to feel good
    throughout the process.</p>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">Here are some key concepts to understanding
    pleasure:</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>Pleasure is a measure of freedom.</li>
      <li>Pleasure is about noticing what makes you feel good and what you
        are curious about.</li>
      <li>Pleasure is about learning about the ways you can increase the
        amount of feeling-good time in your life.</li>
      <li>Pleasure allows you to create more room for joy, wholeness, and
        aliveness and less room for oppression, repression, self-denial, and
        unnecessary suffering.</li>
      <li>Pleasure decreases any internal or projected shame or scarcity
        thinking around the pursuit of pleasure, and it can quiet any voices
        of trauma that keep you from your full sacred sensual life.</li>
      <li>You are allowed to have abundant pleasure.</li>
      <li>When we collectively orient around pleasure we can begin to
        understand that liberation is possible.</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>“ The erotic is a measure between the beginnings of our
    sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings.
    It is an internal sense of satisfaction to which, once
    we have experienced it, we know we can aspire. For
    having experienced the fullness of this depth of
    feeling and recognizing its power, in honor and selfrespect
    we can require no less of ourselves. <span class="quote-name italic">- Excerpt
      from Uses of Erotic: The Erotic as Power by Audre Lorde</span></blockquote>
  <p>So let’s get into it, sex can make us feel good and orgasms are truly the
    best for a lot of different reasons. When it comes to sex, it’s important to
    acknowledge that everyone is different and we all have different likes and
    dislikes. Getting to know yourself sexually and tapping into the power of the
    erotic is a process and a journey. It’s okay to skip to other sections if you’re not
    aligning with this message. Only you get to decide what that looks like.</p>
  <p>Here are some tips if you’re resonating with this message so far. It’s okay if you
    want to come back to this at a later time.</p>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">Masturbation</h3>
  <p>You don’t have to be with someone in order to have wonderful orgasms.
    Masturbation can be a great way to connect with your body and for you to know
    what feels good to you. Masturbation is one way you can reclaim the senses of
    your body and you can explore your own ability to bring pleasure to your body.
    The best part about this is that you are in complete control, you can go as deep
    into your senses as you’re comfortable with and you can stop whenever you
    want. Everyone is different, you can masturbate without sex toys or with sex
    toys, you can do it in front of a mirror or in the shower. You get to decide what
    masturbation looks like for you and at the end of the day, masturbation can be
    a fun and safe method to explore your sexuality. You can read this article, <a href="http://bit.ly/CAREHZ10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sex
    after Trauma: How Masturbation Can Help You Heal</a> if you’re
    curious to explore this route.</p>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">Consensual sex</h3>
  <p>Having safe and consensual sex can allow us to feel that sense of satisfaction
    that is aspired by so many and you have the opportunity to connect with
    your partner(s) more intimately. Here’s what we mean by having
    consent during sex.</p>
  <p class="bold">Consent means...</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Everyone involved should be able
        to freely communicate what they
        do or don’t want, as well as read
        and respect each other’s signals
        and boundaries.</li>
      <li>Everyone involved is sincere in
        their desires and has clearly
        communicated their intent.</li>
      <li>Anyone can change their mind at
        any point in time and they should
        not be pressured or shamed if they
        want to stop sex.</li>
      <li>Choosing to have sex once
        does not mean you are
        choosing to have sex
        every time.
        You need
        consent every
        single time.</li>
      <li class="bold">When a
        person is
        under the
        influence,
        they cannot
        give consent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is never your fault if you were not able to give consent or someone else
    did not respect your sexual boundaries. No one deserves to be sexually
    assaulted or raped and you are not alone. Perhaps that experience is the
    reason you’re reading this zine. We want you to know that what happened
    to you does not define who you are, you can heal from the trauma of sexual
    violence and you deserve a healthy and pleasurable sex life. For this
    reason, consent is especially important because every time you engage in
    consensual sex, it creates new neural pathways in your brain that say sex
    can feel good and you are safe. Through the process of neural plasticity,
    those new neural pathways accumulate over time and they can override
    previous negative experiences.</p>
  <p>At the same time, our body stores memories and sometimes even when
    you’re engaging in pleasurable, safe, and consensual sex, a painful memory
    can arise and now your mind and body no longer feels safe. This is called
    an activation but is commonly referred to as a “trigger”. We choose the word
    activation because the word “trigger” can have a connotation to gun violence
    and the word activation more accurately describes the stress response in
    your nervous system (flight, fight, or freeze) that is activated. When this
    happens your mind and body relive the memory and this can be scary,
    uncomfortable, and frustrating because we get it, you simply want to enjoy
    sex. However, activations during sex are not uncommon and if this happens,
    here’s what you can do.</p>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">Adapted from (adm) “I WANT YOU, BUT I’M
    TRIGGERED” in Pleasure Activism</h3>
  <ol class="subtitled-ol">
    <li>Stop
      <p>Pause what you are doing. If you can speak, say, “Wait, stop, I need
        a moment.” If you can’t speak, remove your partner’s hands from
        your body and step away, holding your hands up. If that is too much,
        just fully withdraw your body from contact. If you know from past
        experiences that you have some triggers, it can help to name this up
        front and let your person know what they can do if you get triggered.
        This is also a good thing to ask a new lover: “Is there anything I might
        do that could trigger you?” Or, “If anything I’m doing doesn’t work for
        you, please say ‘stop’ or hold up your hands.”</p>
    </li>
    <li>Take Time to Recover
      <p>Let your breath return to normal, however long that takes. Notice if
        you are caught in a memory or if you are actually feeling unsafe in the
        present moment. Again, if you can speak, say “Something is coming
        up from my past, I need a moment.” If you can’t speak, closing your
        eyes can help you to establish a boundary around your attention and
        keep it on your own well-being and breath.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Decide What to Share
      <p>You are not obligated to disclose your past trauma. Sharing the details
        of it in or right after the moment of activation may not be appropriate
        for the connection or the moment or your healing. Or it might be
        exactly right. Some options: “I want to share more about my history of
        trauma with you but not right now.” Intimacy, yes, but I need time. This
        might include, “I’d like to continue— but can you avoid [if the activation
        is a physical place or activity, name it as an emerging boundary]?”
        “Are you open to hearing about what’s coming up for me right now?”
        Hearing about other people’s trauma can be hard, even re-traumatizing
        for people. It can also be a swift transition from heavy petting to deep
        sharing. The connection may not be about that kind of depth, even
        if something is coming up in that moment. “I am feeling like myself
        again. I don’t want to talk about it. I would like to keep making out,
        if you’re down.” Sometimes the activation is familiar, and once it
        passes I just want to keep going, not move into a big process moment.
        “Something is coming up for me‚ I’m not ready to share it, I think I [you]
        need to head home.”</p>
    </li>
    <li>Let Your Body Follow Your Words/Desires
      <p>If you want to leave or want your lover to go— make those moves. If
        you have a friend who can come and get you, call them up. You don’t
        need to drive when your system is taken over by trauma. If you want to
        continue the encounter and your lover is still game, start slow. Move
        within the boundaries you need. But it’s really important to know that
        you deserve pleasure. Experiences where you can be activated and
        recover, which usually come after doing healing work at a somatic and/
        or therapeutic level, help to reset your system to know that you can
        enjoy the connections you choose to and reclaim your freedom and
        pleasure inside of spaces absent of harm.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>There are a lot of different ways we can incorporate pleasure in our healing
    journey and we hope we’ve sparked some ideas. As a reminder, you are
    exactly where you need to be. Healing is a nonlinear process and the wide
    range of emotions, even when they are conflicting, are valid.</p>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">Resources:</h3>
  <p>Pleasure Activism is available at the healing library if you’re resonating
    with this message. <span class="bold">If you were activated and would like to talk to a Care
    Advocate, you can <a href="https://bit.ly/CAREForm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">schedule a Care Advocate Appointment.</a></span>
    You can also talk to a therapist or counselor for additional support (you
    can find more information about therapy in the following section). Lastly,
    journaling about this part of your journey and documenting any activations
    that arise can also be really helpful.</p>
