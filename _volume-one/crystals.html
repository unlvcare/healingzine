  <h2>Crystals</h2>
  <p>Crystal stones are ancient minerals that can be used as tools for grounding
    and healing. Everything on this planet, including our thoughts and emotions,
    is comprised of energy. Rocks, gems, and crystals have energetic properties
    that emit a unique vibration that interact with our own energetic vibration and
    can directly affect our physical, emotional, and subtle bodies. When used
    with intention, such as for healing, crystals can provide insight and can offer
    support if your mind and heart are open to it.</p>
  <p>One way crystals can support you is by grounding you to the earth’s energy.
    Grounding means being connected to your physical reality rather than dwelling
    on future or past thoughts. In your healing journey, there will be times when
    you will feel overwhelmed with your emotions and while they are all valid,
    sometimes it can be difficult to focus on the present moment. Wearing jewelry
    with crystals, having crystals at home, or carrying pocket crystals can be
    helpful when you are feeling disconnected from your current reality. You can
    do this by simply bringing your entire awareness to the crystal using as many
    senses as you can. What does it look like? What does it feel like? How does it
    feel touching your skin? Bring your entire awareness to the present moment
    and eventually, you’ll notice that your thoughts are quieter and your body is
    more relaxed. You can do this if you were activated by situation or memory, as
    well as before, during or after therapy, or while you’re journaling. You can also
    meditate holding your crystal in your hand.</p>
  <p>There are lots of ways you can engage with crystals, if this
    healing modality resonates with you, you can purchase
    them online, at a metaphysical store, or you can get one
    at our Healing through Connections workshops. It’s also
    important to be mindful of where you get
    crystals and make sure they are ethically
    sourced.</p>
