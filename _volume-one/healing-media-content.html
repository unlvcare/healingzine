  <h2>Healing Media Content</h2>
  <p>Social media has become part of our day to day life routine. Through social
    media; we stay connected with family and friends, we find out about events,
    and we use social media to laugh at memes or watch funny pet videos. While
    there are lots of benefits to connecting online, social media can also start
    interfering with our life, cause self-esteem issues and it can sometimes take
    a toll on your mental health. You may want to take a break from social media
    if you find yourself getting upset every time you log on, find yourself writing
    rude comments or thinking negative thoughts, or when you start to compare
    your life with that of others. You get to decide how long that break needs to
    be and it can be anywhere between a few hours to a week.</p>
  <p>Also, on social media there is a community of healers that are
    committed to creating positive, informative and uplifting content. They are
    using social media platforms to engage with people on a similar healing
    journey. We encourage you to take a look at, who are you following? Is the
    content you are ingesting uplifting or is it bringing you down? If it uplifts you,
    try to find other people that post similar content. If it brings you down, then
    maybe you might want to unfollow or remove from your feed. If you donâ€™t
    know where to begin, you can start by following us at <a href="http://www.instagram.com/unlv_care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@UNLV_Care</a>.</p>
