  <p>Healing is unique for everyone, and the journey has
    no endpoint. The idea of healing can be overwhelming
    because the images we usually see of it, are of those who
    have already been engaging in healing for an extended
    time. And healing often requires us to reflect on painful
    memories, implement difficult boundaries with loved ones,
    and say no to things that may give us immediate pleasure
    but are really ways of avoiding sustainability.</p>
  <p>There are many different healing tools and modalities. Depending on where
    you are in your journey or what your healing needs are, there may be a different
    tool or modality to support you. In the next few pages, we have a variety of
    healing modalities to get you thinking about what helps you feel whole and
    supported.</p>
  <p>But you may be feeling confused or lost right now, and that’s okay and also
    really common! So to help guide you, we have a “how are you feeling” map. If
    you’re not sure what the feeling you have is called - take a look at the attached
    emotion color wheel to flesh out your feelings. Tip: there’s no wrong answer.
    It’s okay to trust your instinct and see where it takes you on this map. You can
    always return back and see if something fits better!</p>

    <h4 class="bold italic">Disconnected, Difficulty being present, Lost (Section 1, 2, 6)</h4>
    <p>Right now you maybe feeling like
      you aren’t really here. You may
      feel numb, disinterested, and
      maybe having a hard time being
      alone or focusing on anything.
      That’s super common. There are
      some modalities that may help
      you reconnect and get to a place
      where you can explore some of your
      feelings a little more to get to the
      root.</p>

    <h4 class="bold italic">Confused, Scared, Overwhelmed (Section 1)</h4>
    <p>Right now you may not be sure what
        exactly it is that you are feeling
        or you may be feeling so many
        different emotions that you don’t
        know where to start. That’s okay.
        Let’s take some time to explore
        those emotions and get to a place
        of emotional safety so we can
        better address our needs.</p>

    <h4 class="bold italic">Sad, Depressed, Worn out, Depleted (Section 6)</h4>
    <p>Right now you may be feeling
        like you have no energy left,
        overwhelmed by daily tasks
        and having a hard time finding
        motivation. It’s okay to feel like
        this and it’s also common. These
        modalities may not change how you
        feel immediately, and sometimes
        we need professional help as well,
        but they also may begin to work
        overtime. If you’re just not sure
        where or how to start, these are the
        modalities for you.</p>

  <div class="modality-card">
    <h4 class="bold italic">Determined, Ambitious, Ready to throw yourself into some joy and healing (Section 3, 4, 5)</h4>
    <p>Right now you may not know where
        to start but you know you’re ready
        to. You’re craving community,
        connection, and reflection. Maybe
        you’re a little scared that this
        feeling will go away, that’s okay.
        Your feelings like life may come in
        waves. Here are some modalities
        to check out to dive right into the
        healing process.</p>

  <div class="modality-card">
    <h4 class="bold italic">Intense, Complicated, Angry, Confident, Daring (Section 1, maybe Section 3 or 4)</h4>
    <p>Right now you may be feeling a
        lot of different emotions. Maybe
        you’re feeling a rush of adrenaline,
        angry enough to take on the world,
        determined to get things done
        regardless of what the cost may
        be, intense but unsure of where it’s
        coming from, these are all super
        common. It’s important that even
        if you’re feeling invincible after
        trauma, you may still need time to
        grieve. While your body or mind may
        be telling you to take on every new
        project you possibly can, it may be
        beneficial to schedule in down-time
        and rest.</p>
