  <h2>Introduction to Healing</h2>
  <h4 class="bold italic">“Healing is the restoration of identity.”</h4>
  <p>Healing starts with empathy for oneself and requires critical
    reflection and loving action. It requires getting to the root instead of putting band-aids on
    the problem.</p>
  <p class="bold">Healing is a journey.</p>
  <p>Radical healing is important because for many people our
    experiences are a direct result of systems of oppression. For
    victim-survivors thriving is an act of <span class="bold">radical resistance</span>, a
    push against the violent norms of our society. To engage in
    healing is to engage in community power. And no one knows
    what that healing looks like besides you. We are here to
    share tools and context, but we know that you are the expert
    of your own life.</p>
  <p>We encourage healing because future generations depend
    on our collective healing. Healing is the journey from
    surviving to thriving.</p>
  <p>While surviving is an extremely valid way of navigating
    the world, and sometimes the only option for folks,
    understanding the difference between surviving and
    thriving or self-soothing versus self-care can open
    new possibilities.</p>
  <p>Self-soothing is not inherently wrong or bad. Indulgence is
    great, avoidance, however, can prolong trauma. Sometimes
    we need self-soothing to get through the day, week, year.
    <span class="bold">But identifying the difference can empower us to have a
        balance that best supports us.</span></p>
    <div class="flex">
        <div class="half-col">
            <p class="bold">Self-Care:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Long-term benefits</li>
                <li>Connection</li>
                <li>Deep cleaning</li>
                <li>Healing</li>
                <li>Therapy</li>
                <li>Setting boundaries</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="half-col gutter">
            <p class="bold">Self-Soothing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Immediate Satisfaction</li>
                <li>Avoiding conflict</li>
                <li>Bubble bath</li>
                <li>Massage/Facial/Manicure</li>
                <li>Drinking/smoking</li>
                <li>Avoiding conflict</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>And while we saw the impacts of trauma, the good news
        is that our brains have something called neuroplasticity.
        This means that the brain is able to continuously change
        throughout your life. With support and access to healing
        tools over a period of time, your brain can actually heal.
        This doesn’t mean that every day is easy or that traumatic
        events won’t ever impact you again, but it does mean that
        when you have flashbacks or responses to those traumatic
        events, healing may empower you to address those
        responses in a way that best serves you.</p>
