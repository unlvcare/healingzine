  <h2 class="italic">Dear Survivor,</h2>
  <p>Thank you for making your way to this guide. Our goal is to create
    a space and community for you to safely show up exactly as you
    are, and exactly as you are not - all are welcome here. Everyone’s
    healing journey is different and we hope that you are able to use
    this guide in a way that feels right to you. <span class="bold">As you flow through the
    different sections, please remember this:</span></p>
    <ol class="intro-list bold">
      <li>You are not alone</li>
      <li>It is not your fault</li>
      <li>Your feelings (yes, even those ones) are valid</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It’s normal to experience many different feelings, such as
      powerlessness, unsafe, or out of control (or something completely
      different). And while you may be questioning why you are feeling
      the way you are, we want you to know that nothing is wrong with
      you; your feelings and responses to trauma are valid. This guide
      will hopefully provide you with some insight on how trauma can
      impact us, and how to address those different impacts.</p>
    <p>We wanted to share this quote in hopes that it will resonate in the
      way that feels best in this moment:</p>
    <blockquote class="bold">“I am deserving of healing, of
      generosity to myself, of patience as
      I stumble and celebration as I grow.
      I commit to myself to pull from the
      tools within me to surround myself
      with the support, love, and guidance
      that I need." <span class="quote-name italic"><br>- CARE Center, inspired by healers
        and those who engage in healing (Amita Swadhin,
        Adrienne Maree Brown, Brené Brown, Desiré Galvez)</span></blockquote>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to look at this guide, to
      make time for yourself and to engage in healing even when it
      seems impossible.</p>
