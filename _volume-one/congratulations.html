  <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
  <p>Whether you’ve engaged in new healing modalities, thought
    about your needs or just took a few moments to reflect -
    congratulations! You’re beginning a journey that can be
    challenging, overwhelming and also rewarding. Whether you
    tried a bunch of healing modalities, found one that really
    helped, or just read the back cover, we’re proud of you. You are
    deserving of healing and patience, and you’re not alone.</p>
  <p>We want to leave you with this final quote:</p>
  <blockquote>"I am not broken,
    I am a fluid
    being ebbing and
    flowing with the
    waves of life. And
    I am searching
    for the balance
    within to remain
    steady in these
    waves." <span class="quote-name italic">- CARE Center</span></blockquote>
