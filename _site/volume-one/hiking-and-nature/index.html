  <h2>Hiking & Nature</h2>
  <p>Nature teaches us a lot about what it takes to not only survive but to thrive
    in the world. It teaches us about resilience and our innate capacity to heal.
    Connecting to nature can remind us of our connection to the world and that
    we are not alone. It can physically help us center ourselves and be mindful
    of the scenery around us.</p>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">How does connecting with nature help us heal
    from trauma?</h3>
  <p>Here are three ways that connecting to nature helps us recreate our whole
    and healthier selves, and ultimately helps us heal from the wounds of
    trauma.</p>
  <ol>
      <li><span class="bold">Nature can help us to Ground</span> – to feel rooted in our bodies and
        connected to our surroundings with present moment awareness.
        When we develop the skills to Ground, we can transform powerful,
        and traumatic, emotions with mindfulness, allowing them to
        become productive and unstuck. When we’re grounded we are
        able to touch into painful emotions and sensations without being
        overwhelmed. Trauma emotions stick in our body, and becoming
        unstuck from these emotions in a safe way requires us to be
        Grounded.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Nature can help us find our power. </span>Trauma is a thief of our
        personal power, and it is incredibly liberating to regain that power.
        Nature provides us with opportunities and challenges that help us
        reconnect to our inner strength. Whether it’s finding the strength
        to complete a difficult challenge, discovering the patience and care
        to plant a garden, or feeling the safety in being in a natural place,
        nature has opportunities for powerful change.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Nature is an amazing teacher, full of metaphors and life
        lessons. </span>It is a vast and ever-changing tapestry of plants and
        animals, water and fire, earth and sky. Observing the how, what,
        when, where, and why of these changes often serves as a mirror to
        our own experiences in life, providing us with powerful insights on
        how we can grow and heal. In nature, we’re reminded that painful
        experiences do not have to define the rest of our lives.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>When you’re out in nature here’s an activity you can do using all five of your
    senses; sight, smell, sound, touch, and taste. Bring your awareness to your
    surroundings.</p>
  <ol class="subtitled-ol">
    <li>What do you see?
      <p>Pay attention to the different colors of the plants, trees and maybe
      animals.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Can you smell anything?
      <p>Pay attention to the smells of pine, fresh air, soil or water.</p>
    </li>
    <li>What can you hear?
      <p>Pay attention to the sounds, it could be the wind, birds chirping, moving cars, or the sound of you walking.</p>
    </li>
    <li>What are the sensations around your body?
      <p>Pay attention to what your body feels, feel the wind, stop and hug a
        tree, the rocks or dirt on your feet, pick up a rock and hold in your
        hand.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Can you taste anything?
      <p>Pay attention to the flavors inside your mouth maybe it’s the food
        you ate earlier and if you’re brave enough taste the dirt.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
  <p>It’s okay if it’s hard to be present at first, the more you focus on different
    senses, the more present you’ll become. UNLV has lots of beautiful
    trees and desert landscape, you don’t have to go far to enjoy the
    beauty of nature. You don’t have to be outdoors to connect with
    nature, you can also listen to nature sounds on youtube or Spotify.</p>
