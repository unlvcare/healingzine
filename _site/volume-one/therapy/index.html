  <h2>Therapy</h2>
  <p>Psychotherapy, or more commonly referred to as “therapy,” can
    be very beneficial to victim-survivors. There are different types of
    therapists/counselors, some may be counselors, or social workers,
    or psychologists, and they provide clients different ways to cope with
    life that may impact their mental health and wellness. In therapy,
    a professional relationship is created to help you work through a
    specific issue or explore larger patterns that exist, change things
    that may not be working, deal with feelings, learn coping skills/
    techniques/strategies for stress or negative symptoms, or talk about
    things in a safe, non-judgmental space that is confidential. All of
    these can help to promote healing. Generally, what is said to a
    therapist will remain private, and there are a few exceptions to this
    rule to keep the client and others safe.</p>
  <p>You can always ask questions of the therapist to see if they have
    had experience with trauma, interpersonal violence, or your specific
    type of concern. Therapy is your personal processing space and
    needs to feel right, so it is okay to ask for specific requests or to
    request a change if you do not believe that you and your therapist
    are a good match.</p>
  <div class="zine-card">
    <h3 class="zine-subhead">Therapy can be helpful in the short-term or long-term.</h3>
    <p>A therapist can help to learn about yourself by pointing
        out patterns and giving you honest feedback. Some
        therapy is provided during one-on-one individual visits, and
        some therapy is provided in small groups for people with
        similar concerns. Some mental health concerns cannot
        be managed by psychotherapy alone. If medication is
        recommended, it’s probably for an important reason, but
        is not required to participate in therapy. Benefiting from
        therapy does require open-mindedness, and work on your
        part – you will get as much out of therapy as the effort you
        are willing to put in to try new techniques or think about
        things differently.</p>
