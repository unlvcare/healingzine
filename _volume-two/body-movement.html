  <h2>Body Movement</h2>
  <p>Another tool for healing is body movement. Because our bodies are the vessels which carry us throughout the world, they are often the targets of violence - whether that be direct interpersonal violence or indirect systemic oppression. This can damage our bodies and make them wary of the world.</p>
  <p>It’s entirely normal to feel discomfort and even shame when thinking about our bodies, especially after experiencing violence. We want you to know that your body is special and resilient. But if you’re not ready to focus on your body at this time, you can always skip this section and move on to another one you feel prepared for. Healing is a process. And that’s okay.</p>
  <p>Trauma can impact us physically, both immediately afterwards and even chronically. This can look like having anxiety, trouble sleeping, gastrointestinal issues, musculoskeletal problems, among others.⁴¹ Incorporating movement into our daily routines can provide an added benefit in relieving some of those symptoms. For example, some people may find that going to a dance class, expending their energy, then going home to take a shower before bed helps them sleep better. Finding time to stretch before a long day at a desk might help someone prevent or manage their sciatica. Someone experiencing joint pain or arthritis might find relief and improved movability by incorporating strength/weight training (using weights to develop one’s muscles and ensure they are working as intended).⁴² Sometimes, our bodies just need a little movement to relieve things like trapped air in our muscles or organs. Use your body to jump, stretch or just shake it out. Our bodies long to work, after all, to carry us where we need to go. Trauma may slow us down, but we can get our bodies back to optimal use.</p>
  <p>Listening to our bodies and giving them what they need is also a helpful tool for grounding when we feel overwhelmed. In this way, moving our bodies isn’t only a physical benefit, but a mental and emotional one, too. This makes body movement a triple threat!</p>
  <p>There is no right or wrong way to move. It’s normal to feel shame or frustration when we see others incorporating physical activity into their lives that just isn’t fun for us or that we physically aren’t able to do. Good thing for us that there are hundreds of ways to move our bodies! Do what feels good, and not painful. Do it for as long as you want, when you want.</p>
  <p>Common activities include running, stretching, weight-lifting, balancing, dancing, walking and playing.⁴³ These activities can release heightened emotions, relieve stress and anxiety, maintain your body in good health and function, and make you feel powerful.</p>
  <p>Next time you feel a physical ache or your anxiety increasing, we invite you to pause what you’re doing and try one of the activities above. Have a dance party by yourself or with friends. Play a game of tag or basketball. Stretch your back on a comfy exercise mat.</p>
  <p>After testing the waters, you may want to schedule times to focus on moving your body. You can incorporate different kinds of movement on certain days. The more variety you offer your body, the stronger it will become and the more new things it will learn.</p>
