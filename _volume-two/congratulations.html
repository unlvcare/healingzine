  <h2>Congratulations</h2>
  <p>Healing definitely works in strange ways. And there is no one way to heal. Everyone’s journey is unique, but we hope you have found useful tools in this zine to help you on yours. So, congratulations! You’ve made it to the end! We hope you enjoyed the 2nd edition of the Student’s Guide to Radical Healing zine, which was written, designed and published by UNLV Care Center staff, Care Advocates, UNLV Student Diversity and Social Justice, and members of the Las Vegas Community.</p>
  <p>While this zine is specifically geared towards college students, a lot of the content is relevant to anyone working toward healing, and our goal is to reach as many people as possible. If you found this zine to be beneficial, feel free to share it with your friends, family, coworkers, classmates, followers, etc.!</p>
  <p>If you would like to submit recommendations for future editions of the zine, feel free to reach out via our socials or via email. You can find our contact information and a list of resources on the following pages.</p>
  <p>As we navigate the struggles of our daily lives, we hope you’ll find a sense of community and hope within this zine and the folks who have poured their love into it. By healing together, we expand and fortify the network we are building toward a better future.</p>
