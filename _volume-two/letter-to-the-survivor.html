  <h2 class="italic">Dear Survivor,</h2>
  <p>We are so grateful you have made it to the second edition of the Student's Guide to Radical Healing zine. Our intention is to continue to offer a space that validates your lived experience and the ways you respond to what happened to you. This zine is designed as a guide where you can learn about your nervous system, different types of traumas, and self-regulating tools. You are a student of your own healing journey. As you read through the zine, please keep in mind:</p>
  <ol class="intro-list bold">
    <li>You are not defined by what happened to you.</li>
    <li>There's no shame in how you respond to trauma.</li>
    <li>You are allowed to recreate a sense of safety in your mind, body, and spirit.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>When we look deeply at the parts of ourselves that have been hurt, we can offer them the love, support, and resources they deserve and need. For this reason, we encourage you to study your own experiences of trauma. By doing so, we can activate our innate resilience, and we can move past the state of surviving. We believe you have the capacity to flourish and thrive.</p>
  <p>We share the affirmation below in hopes it helps you challenge and overcome the negative thoughts that are part of every healing journey.</p>
  <blockquote class="bold">"I am resilient. I give myself the space, the grace, and the opportunity to evolve. I allow myself to outgrow old traumas.
    I recognize my inner strength to hold the uncomfortable feelings that accompany my evolution, and I acknowledge my fear while I stay engaged with my process. I am committed to experience life beyond what I know at the moment. My healing journey is sacred and full of purpose."</blockquote>
  <p>Lastly, we pay homage and respect to all healers that continue to inspire us and pave the way toward collective healing and liberation. This year we partnered with the office of Student Diversity and Social Justice (SDSJ). They provide identity specific support & resources to UNLV students being systematically marginalized. The Care Center is forever grateful for their contributions and collaboration.  </p>
