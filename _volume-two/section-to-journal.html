  <h2>Section to Journal</h2>
  <p>It can be stressful to read about ways that trauma can impact people, but we hope the healing responses and reflection questions shared in the previous sections provide tangible ways to navigate it. We cannot always control our environments, but what we can control is how we protect and recenter ourselves. A helpful practice can be journaling. Or doodling. Or stamping! We invite you to use these free pages however you like. You may find yourself feeling a little more relaxed once youâ€™ve glided a marker across it!</p>
