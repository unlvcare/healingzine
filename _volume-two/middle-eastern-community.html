  <h2>Middle Eastern Communities</h2>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">1. Xenophobia<sup>27</sup>:</h3>
  <p>Ever since Middle Easterners became migrant workers in 1973, many have been the target of xenophobia. Middle Easterners often experience stereotyping and vilification based on their country of origin.</p>
  <p class="bold">Healing Responses/Practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Join support groups for solidarity and use your voice and raise awareness</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="highlight">Reflection Question: How do you respond to your experiences with discrimination?</span></p>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">2. Racial profiling<sup>28</sup>:</h3>
  <p>Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the stereotypical fear that Middle Easterners are terrorists, government institutions (e.g police) have been targeting Middle Easterners based on their religion or ethnicity.</p>
  <p class="bold">Healing Responses/Practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Seek therapy and safe spaces to process emotions and trauma regarding these issues</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="highlight">Reflection Question: What role does racial profiling within society play in your experiences?</span></p>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">3. The U.S. Census<sup>29</sup>:</h3>
  <p>Middle Eastern Americans are instructed to put that they are white on forms, such as applications and the U.S Census. This can cause distress because Middle Eastern people are not seen as being white nor do they  benefit from the advantages of being white.</p>
  <p class="bold">Healing Responses/Practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Seek therapy and safe spaces to process emotions and trauma regarding these issues</li>
    <li>Seek safe spaces and communities that can relate to these struggles</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="highlight">Reflection Question: What are some ways you embrace and celebrate your ethnic identity?</span></p>
