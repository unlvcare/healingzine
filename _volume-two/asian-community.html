  <h2>Asian Communities</h2>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">1. The Immigration/Refugee Experience<sup>14</sup>:</h3>
  <p>Migrating to Western countries while dealing with culture shock, identity loss, and learned importance of Eastern philosophy can be traumatizing, resulting in poverty, violence, PTSD, limited education, etc.</p>
  <p class="bold">Healing Responses/Practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Seek treatment for stress, depression, and trauma to be connected to the right resources, and join support groups</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="highlight">Reflection Question: What are ways to adapt and balance both your ethnic culture and U.S culture?</span></p>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">2. COVID-19 Xenophobia<sup>15 16</sup>:</h3>
  <p>There have been many cases of violence toward the Asian community. Many, especially Asian elders, have experienced beatings, violent bullying, threats, racist abuse, discrimination, and even death. </p>
  <p class="bold">Healing Responses/Practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Engage in mental breaks from social media or the news</li>
    <li>Continue to raise awareness and support other Asians</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="highlight">Reflection Question: How does this increasing Anti-Asian sentiment make you feel?</span></p>
  <h3 class="zine-subhead">3. Intergenerational Trauma<sup>17 18 19</sup>:</h3>
  <p>When Asian immigrants migrate, they become a minority in a new country while maintaining Asian customs, passing on parts of their experience onto offspring. Younger generations struggle within their new country with issues such as racism, exclusion, self-identity, etc.</p>
  <p class="bold">Healing Responses/Practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Begin conversations regarding trauma with our communities and join safe spaces to raise awareness and reclaim the narrative about these issues</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="highlight">Reflection Question: How do you or your family perform intergenerational healing?</span></p>
