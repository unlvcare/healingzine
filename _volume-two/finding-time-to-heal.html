  <h2>Finding Time to Heal</h2>
  <p>Finding the time and capacity to heal or address your needs while navigating school, work, and life can be overwhelming. When we’ve experienced trauma, it can be difficult to slow down and be present to what’s on our plate. Being present can be scary and unsafe if we haven’t processed our trauma. First, it may be helpful to create a support system to create a safe environment in which you can be present. If you’re not ready to talk to someone yet, that’s okay. One idea is to put on a tv show or playlist while you sift through your calendar/planner. Have a plan in place in case you are activated.</p>
  <p>Here is a proposed process for finding time to heal:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Get a planner/pull up your google calendar (be mindful of what you are able to update and follow best).</li>
    <li>Pick the current or coming up week and add all of your time commitments (work shifts, classes, study time, volunteer hours, family time, workouts, game nights, sleep, eating, everything).</li>
    <li>Take a deep breath - it’s not uncommon to now look at your planner and think “I have negative time available”. That’s okay! This is to empower you to make decisions that are best for you and your needs, not to shame yourself.</li>
    <li>Make a list of your priorities, these are things you HAVE to do.
      <p>For example, the amount of shifts you need to work to pay your bills, the classes you need to graduate or maintain a scholarship, the volunteer hours that impact your resume and future job, your self-care like eating, sleeping, and things that bring you joy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Make a list of the things you can take off your plate and be honest with yourself. Ask yourself why you can’t take
      something off your plate. If the answer is that it will impact your needs - then you probably can’t. If the answer is that you feel obligated or guilty saying no, that’s valid! Give yourself some space to process that guilt and remind yourself that you are not meant to be a machine. When you prioritize your needs you are better able to sustain yourself and you can show up in a way that is authentic to you.</li>
    <li>Make adjustments, delete the things you can, schedule calls or send emails to request support or flexibility where you can. For example, maybe you need to meet with your advisor to explore extending graduation, or financial aid to explore financial support, or your supervisor for a more flexible schedule or even a raise!</li>
    <li>Reschedule your week with your new priorities and compare them to your needs. Are you meeting your needs every day? If not, what resources can you utilize to get there?</li>
    <li>Revisit your schedule regularly and make adjustments. Set up reminders and alarms and make your self-care as immovable as your other commitments.</li>
  </ol>
